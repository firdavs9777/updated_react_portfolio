# Recommendations for Attracting Employers

## Content Strategy

### 1. Lead with Impact Stories
- **Problem-Solution-Impact Format**: Start each achievement by describing the problem you solved, then your approach, and finally the impact
- **User-Centered**: Always connect technical work to user experience or business value
- **Specific Examples**: Instead of "worked on projects," say "built a marketplace platform serving 10,000+ users"

### 2. Show Growth Mindset
- Mention learning new technologies or taking on challenges
- Highlight how you adapted to new situations
- Show progression in your skills over time

### 3. Highlight Collaboration
- Emphasize teamwork and cross-functional work
- Mention specific teams or departments you worked with
- Show how you acted as a bridge between technical and non-technical teams

### 4. Demonstrate Leadership
- Even as an individual contributor, show how you influenced others
- Mention mentoring, code reviews, or knowledge sharing
- Highlight times you took initiative beyond your role

### 5. Connect to Business Value
- Link technical work to user experience or business outcomes
- Show how your work helped the company achieve goals
- Mention user feedback or business metrics when relevant

## Language & Tone Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Use "I" statements: "I built..." instead of "was built..."
- Active voice: "I created..." not "was created..."
- Specific examples: "Built a marketplace platform" not "worked on projects"
- Show passion: Use words that convey enthusiasm
- Quantify when meaningful: Use metrics to support stories, not as the main point
- Tell stories: Problem → Solution → Impact

### ❌ DON'T:
- Avoid robotic metrics: "Improved by 35%" without context
- Don't use passive voice excessively
- Avoid generic statements: "Worked on various projects"
- Don't list technologies without context
- Avoid jargon without explanation
